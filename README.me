# Automated Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
The **Automated Inventory Management System** is a C++ project designed to manage inventory efficiently. It utilizes file I/O for data storage, data structures for organizing inventory, and automated stock management features to keep track of inventory levels and generate reports.

## Features
- **Inventory Management**: Add, remove, and update stock levels.
- **Automated Reordering**: Restock items when levels fall below a threshold.
- **File-Based Data Storage**: Save and load inventory data using file I/O.
- **Sales and Restocking Simulation**: Track sales and automate inventory replenishment.
- **Report Generation**: Generate low-stock reports and sales trends.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Read and write inventory data to files.
- **Data Structures**: Use `std::vector` or `std::map` for efficient inventory management.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement automated reordering logic.
- **Report Generation**: Format and export reports.

## 30-Day Development Plan
### Week 1: Learn Basics and Plan
- **Day 1-3**: Review C++ basics and learn about `std::vector` and `std::map`.
- **Day 4-5**: Implement file I/O for saving and loading inventory data.
- **Day 6-7**: Learn conditional logic and loops for automation.

### Week 2: Core Implementation
- **Day 8-10**: Create a class to represent inventory items.
- **Day 11-12**: Implement inventory tracking features.
- **Day 13-14**: Simulate sales and restocking events.

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- **Day 15-17**: Add automated reordering logic.
- **Day 18-20**: Implement report generation.

### Week 4: Testing and Refinement
- **Day 21-23**: Write test cases for all features.
- **Day 24-26**: Refactor code for readability and efficiency.
- **Day 27-30**: Implement logging and finalize the project.
