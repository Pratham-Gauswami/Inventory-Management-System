# Automated Inventory Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Automated Inventory Management System** is a C++ application designed to streamline inventory tracking and management. It utilizes **file I/O** for data storage, **data structures** for organizing inventory efficiently, and **automated stock management** to keep inventory levels updated and generate reports.

## 🚀 Features
- **📦 Inventory Management**: Add, remove, and update stock levels.
- **🔄 Automated Reordering**: Restocks items when levels fall below a predefined threshold.
- **🗂 File-Based Data Storage**: Saves and loads inventory data using file I/O.
- **📊 Sales and Restocking Simulation**: Tracks sales and automates inventory replenishment.
- **📄 Report Generation**: Creates reports for low-stock alerts and sales trends.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Read and write inventory data to files.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes `std::vector` and `std::map` for efficient inventory tracking.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implements automated reordering and threshold alerts.
- **Report Generation**: Formats and exports structured reports.

## 🏗 30-Day Development Plan
### 📅 Week 1: Learning & Planning
- **Day 1-3**: Review C++ basics, focusing on `std::vector` and `std::map`.
- **Day 4-5**: Implement file I/O for inventory data storage.
- **Day 6-7**: Design the inventory system structure and automation logic.

### 📅 Week 2: Core Implementation
- **Day 8-10**: Create an `InventoryItem` class.
- **Day 11-12**: Implement stock addition, removal, and updates.
- **Day 13-14**: Simulate sales and automatic restocking.

### 📅 Week 3: Advanced Features
- **Day 15-17**: Develop automated reordering and threshold alerts.
- **Day 18-20**: Implement report generation for sales trends and low-stock alerts.

### 📅 Week 4: Testing & Optimization
- **Day 21-23**: Write test cases to validate system performance.
- **Day 24-26**: Optimize code for efficiency and readability.
- **Day 27-30**: Implement logging, finalize features, and prepare for deployment.

## 🛠 Getting Started
### 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
