Why Separate Files?

Modularity: Keeping the dialog in a separate file makes your code more organized
and easier to maintain.
Reusability: If you need to use the dialog in other
parts of your application, you can simply include the header file.
Readability: Separating concerns (e.g., UI dialogs vs. business logic) makes your code easier
to understand.
